RollbackPrototype is intended to be a barebones, simple-as-possible fighting game that incorporates rollback netcode into online play.
Because rollback is so important in creating a playable online experience in the modern day, 
and because using rollback demands certain design aspects in the inner workings of the game, 
I consider tackling the problem of how to design a fighting game with rollback netcode 
to be the critical first step in designing a good fighting game.

Version 0.0 provides only the most barebones core features of a fighting game, and does not yet have
online play, let alone rollback netcode.
Two players can play a single, best-3-of-5-rounds game, with a character only capable of moving and attacking.

CONTROLS------------
